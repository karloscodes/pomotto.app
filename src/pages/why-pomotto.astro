        Why Pomotto?

      <p class="mb-6 text-lg">
        <b>Introducing Pomotto: A Pomodoro Timer for the Hyper-Focused</b><br>
        Pomotto is designed to keep you accountable, intensely focused, and energized throughout your day—without the overwhelm of complexity or disconnection.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-6 text-lg">
        As someone with a hyper-focused mind, I often found myself so engrossed in work that I'd lose track of time, forget about the world around me, and risk burnout. After trying numerous Pomodoro apps, I couldn't find one that let me harness my intense focus without falling into rabbit holes or missing critical notifications.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-6 text-lg">
        That's why I created Pomotto—a solution tailored for the hyper-focused, leveraging Mac's Do Not Disturb (DnD) feature to help you dive deep while staying connected to what matters. It strikes the perfect balance between concentration and awareness, ensuring you thrive without burning out.
      </p>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Key Features</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-lg">
        <li><b>Sound Reminders:</b> Gentle chimes at the end of each session ease you out of deep focus, preventing jarring interruptions</li>
        <li><b>Visual Cues:</b> Subtle screen flashes signal session boundaries, keeping you aligned without disrupting your flow</li>
        <li><b>Do Not Disturb Integration:</b> Blocks distractions via Mac's DnD while letting critical notifications through—ideal for hyper-focused work</li>
        <li><b>Simple, Intuitive Design:</b> Minimal complexity avoids distracting your focused mind, with sensible defaults to prevent setup rabbit holes</li>
        <li><b>Sensible Defaults:</b> Minimal configuration options ensure you spend less time setting up and more time being productive</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mb-6 text-lg">
        These features work in harmony to create a balanced, sustainable rhythm. Pomotto helps you leverage your ability to hyper-focus while providing structure to control tendencies toward endless rabbit holes.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">The Power of Pomodoro</h2>
      <p class="mb-6 text-lg">
        The Pomodoro technique, recommended by productivity expert Tim Ferriss in his book Four Hour Work Week, leverages Parkinson's Law – the idea that work expands to fill the time available for its completion. By setting focused work intervals, you create a sense of urgency and improve productivity. <a href="https://fourhourworkweek.com/" class="font-semibold hover:underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[2]</a>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law" class="font-semibold hover:underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[1]</a>
      </p>
      <p class="mb-6 text-lg">
        While it may seem counterintuitive to break your focus, especially for those who thrive in deep work states, the Pomodoro technique actually helps control and balance your energy in a more sustainable way. Studies have shown that regular breaks can improve focus, creativity, and overall productivity. <a href="https://thewellbeingthesis.org.uk/foundations-for-success/importance-of-taking-breaks-and-having-other-interests/" class="font-semibold hover:underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[3]</a> <a href="https://learningcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/taking-breaks/" class="font-semibold hover:underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[4]</a>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Design Philosophy: Simplicity Meets Hyper-Focus</h2>
      <p class="mb-6 text-lg">
        At the heart of Pomotto's design is a commitment to simplicity and minimalism. I believe the best tools get out of your way and let you focus on what matters most—your work. With a clean interface, intuitive controls, and carefully curated customization options, Pomotto ensures you spend less time configuring and more time being productive.
